    <h3>MAINTENANCE</h3>

    <p>Comprehensive annual maintenance services, which include implementation as well as
      consultancy, are provided to ensure optimum results and long life of new and existing
      rainwater harvesting systems. Maintenance services are offered either as a standalone
      offer or as an Annual Maintenance Contract. Activities involved in maintenance are
      decided based on unique requirements of a rainwater harvesting system. If customer is
      capable of deploying his own labour and material then we can provide maintenance
      consultancy also.</p>

    <p>Success of a rainwater harvesting system depends on its timely and proper maintenance. Like
      any other system, maintenance is an integral activity required to sustain, retain and improve
      the efficiency of a rainwater harvesting system. Ignoring this crucial aspect will lead to
      <b>inefficient recharge & storage, contamination of groundwater & stored rainwater,
      wastage of rainwater as overflow, leakage problems which may pose damage to
      building, flooding of the premises, irreversible problems in rainwater harvesting system
      itself and significant reduction in life expectancy of the system.</b> All these problems will
      make investment in rainwater harvesting null over a period of time and defeat the very
      purpose for which it has been implemented.</p>

    <h4>Maintenance Frequency</h4>

    <p>Once a year in the months of <b><u>January to May</u></b><sup>*</sup> before onset of rainy season.</p>
  
    <p><sup>*</sup><b><i>This is the most suitable time period for maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems due
      to dry pits and no hindrance to work since there are no rains. We do not undertake
      maintenance work during rainy season (June to September).</i></b></p>

    <h4><sup>#</sup>Activities involved in maintenance</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>De-silting of rainwater harvesting pits</li>
      <li>Cleaning & re-laying of filter media</li>
      <li>Replacing existing filter media with fresh filter media</li>
      <li>Development of recharge bore well with bailing machine</li>
      <li>Repairs & replacement required in civil structures</li>
      <li>Repairs & replacement required in rainwater piping system</li>
      <li>Cleaning & replacing mesh in chambers & pits</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Experience the edge - Get your rainwater harvesting system maintained by us</h4>

    <p>
      Being an enterprise working exclusively in the field of rainwater harvesting we have a firm
belief that we understand key aspects of working of the system better than any layman point
of view. Apart from the usual activities mentioned above, which we perform with our utmost
precision, we provide following additional services which make any maintenance program
complete:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Making provision of tasks & components in the maintenance program which are
        essential but not previously incorporated at the time of construction of rainwater
        harvesting system</li>
      <li>Assessment of existing rainwater harvesting system on its adequacy for the given
        catchment area</li>
      <li>Testing of bore well water or rainwater stored in tanks on desired parameters through
        an approved laboratory</li>
      <li>Communicating operating guidelines to customer to ensure proper functioning of
        rainwater harvesting system</li>
      <li>Annual Maintenance Contract to dispel your maintenance worries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><sup>#</sup><b><i>Each rainwater harvesting system is distinct and may require a different set of activities
      from amongst those listed above.</i></b></p>

    <h3>PRECIPURE<sup>TM</sup> RAINWATER FILTRATION SYSTEMS</h3>

    <p>
      PRECIPURE<sup>TM</sup> is one of its kind in-house developed rainwater filtration system with the
primary objective of bringing affordability and convenience in rainwater harvesting. It is
unique due to its simple user-friendly design and can be used in
groundwater recharge as well as rainwater storage systems.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Contributes to significant cost reduction by being a
        replacement for conventional filtration & de-silting
        components of a rainwater harvesting system</li>
      <li>High flow rate due to shearing action of water on the screen makes rainwater
        harvesting possible even from large roofs</li>
      <li>No moving parts</li>
      <li>Filter element is 150-1000 micron SS304 V-Wire screen with unique non-clogging
        continuous slot design</li>
      <li>Compact design ensures installation in very less space</li>
      <li>Can be installed easily & quickly by plumber or semi-skilled labour</li>
      <li>Adaptable to site conditions - can be installed aboveground well as underground</li>
      <li>Easy, infrequent and no cost maintenance â€“ can be conveniently done by user</li>
      <li>Coupled with a first flush system, it effectively removes physical impurities from
        rainwater so as to reduce silt load on filter element thus improving its efficiency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>GROUNDWATER INVESTIGATION SERVICES</h2>

    <p>Groundwater and underground strata survey with the help of various geophysical techniques
      such as resistivity survey, recharge test, aquifer pumping test, etc. is our other important
      offering.</p>

    <h4>Most common purposes for which groundwater investigation services are required are:</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Drilling of new bore wells or construction of dug wells for groundwater extraction</b> <br/>
        <p>Groundwater survey is used to scientifically estimate the most appropriate location, depth, yield
          and water quality of the aquifer. Accordingly design of groundwater extraction structure such as a
          bore well or a dug well is recommended. This helps prevent unnecessary expenditure incurred on
          random drilling which may not yield satisfactory results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Drilling of rainwater recharge bore wells</b> <br/>
        <p>Groundwater survey plays an important part in identifying aquifers with good recharge potential.
          Design of rainwater recharge bore well can accordingly be recommended so as to maximise the
          efficiency and life of recharge bore well.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>To determine possible solutions of artificial underground drainage of excess water in water-
          logged areas</b> <br/>
        <p>Groundwater survey is used to identify aquifers with good recharge potential in water logged
          areas. These aquifers can then be used to drain off excess water accumulating on surface in areas
          prone to water logging.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>CHAMBULES</h2>

    <p>Understanding the practical problems faced by plumbers, building owners and builders in
      arranging expert masons for construction of chambers for various water lines in the
      building, we have developed this product. These RCC modules have unique features
      which impart benefits of significant savings in time and labour.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ready-to-install RCC chamber modules. Can effectively replace brick mortar chambers.</li>
      <li>Can also be used to make trenches and small size tanks.</li>
      <li>Savings in time and labour costs.</li>
      <li>Sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>Modules can be joined horizontally as well as vertically withinterlocking joints to achieve desired dimensions of the chamber.</li>
      <li>Provision of inlet and outlet pipe connections in modules ensures no
        damage to walls while making pipe connections which happens to be the case in
        conventional chambers. This also ensures no need of simultaneous laying of pipeline.
        Chamber installation can be done independently.</li>
      <li>Due to smooth finish, plaster on the walls is not required.</li>
      <li>Can be covered by regular size manhole covers available in the market.</li>
      <li>Ready mix mortar for filling joints can also be provided alongside
        to further reduce material and carriage costs.</li>
      <li>Can be installed above ground also for other applications.</li>
    </ul>
